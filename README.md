# sms-voting-game

## Rules
- You get 1 vote and a pin number when you register by texting your name
- You give 1 vote when you text someone elses pin number
- You don't have to register to vote for someone
- You can't vote for yourself
- You can't vote for anyone more than once

## Ideas
- exponential voting
- display amount to be donated to charity on the scoreboard
- Pin numbers vs. names
    - pins are harder to guess, you have to talk to someone to vote for them / have them vote for you
    - names might be easier and lesse clunky
